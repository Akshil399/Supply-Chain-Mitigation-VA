# Supply-Chain-Mitigation-VA
Supply chain disruptions pose serious business challenges, impacting efficiency, profitability, and customer satisfaction. This project outlines the creation of a Supply Chain Disruption Mitigation Virtual Assistant designed to deliver real-time insights, predictive analytics, and actionable guidance. Leveraging advanced language models, the virtual assistant helps supply chain professionals navigate risks such as geopolitical conflicts, environmental regulations, and supplier issues. The system enhances decision-making by integrating data from industry reports, government sources, and business metrics. This innovative approach bolsters supply chain resilience, minimizing downtime and financial impacts through data-driven strategies.
